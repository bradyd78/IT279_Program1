# IT279_Program1
First, you will write a program using the stack class that that checks C++ programs for
the balancing symbols (/* */, ( ), [ ], and { }). You need not ignore the contents of
comments. The program will read in a file and output only one of four messages. You
will stop checking as soon as you find one of the errors. Your message must match the
examples precisely.
